<b>Personal Loan Features & Benefits</b>
•No end-use restriction

•Quick disbursals
•Loan amount of up to Rs. 40 lakh or more based on lenders' discretion
•Interest rates offered by top lenders usually start from 10.50% p.a.

Personal Loan Eligibility:
•Age: 18 - 60 years
•Income: Minimum salary of Rs 15,000 per month
•Credit Score: Preferably 700 & above
Customers applying for a Personal Loan should note that:
Those planning to avail personal loans should also look into APR when considering loan options. The APR (Annual Percentage Rate) of a personal loan is the loan’s annualised cost of borrowing, which includes the interest rates and other fees charged during the loan origination such as the processing fees and documentation fees. APR is expressed in percentage and allows loan applicants to identify personal loan schemes offered at lower interest rates but with higher processing fees and/or other charges.
For example, suppose you avail a personal loan of Rs 4 lakh @ 11% p.a. with a repayment tenure of 5 years and processing fee of 1.5% of loan amount. With these loan details, the processing fee for your loan will be Rs 6,000, total interest cost would be Rs 1,21,818 and the total cost of borrowing will be Rs 5,21,818 and the APR for your loan will be 11.66%."

org.telegram.messenger,"Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 800 million active users.

FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.

UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. 

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. 

100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. 

POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. 

FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.

PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.

For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today."

How did we create this fast grocery delivery app:

You place an order. Our online delivery wizards pick it up. Our pickers & packers at the dark store are notified. They maneuver stacked aisles to collect the groceries you placed in your order. Meanwhile, a delivery partner gets assigned. Lots happening? We're only 1 minute in, at this point. The packer hands over the order to the delivery partner, who drives at an average speed of 20km/hr to safely deliver groceries to your doorstep. 

You woke up and ran out of your much-loved Nescafe Classic or the creamy Country Delight? No sweat, just browse the wide range of flavourful brews from Sleepy Owl to Society Tea. We’re the beverages and milk delivery app you’ve been waiting for. 

For those rushed mornings, we get you ready in a jiffy. Get everything from Dove soaps and Pears body washes to Mamaearth shampoos and L’oreal Paris conditioners.

Night’s still young? Catch up on chores with cleaning essentials delivered to you in 10 minutes, or set the stage for a party at home.
